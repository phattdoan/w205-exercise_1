### Phat Doan
### w205 Section 2 - Fall 2017
### Exercise 1

**Question to answer**
1/ What hospitals are models of high-quality care? That is, which hospitals have the most consistently high scores for a variety of procedures.
2/ What states are models of high-quality care?
3/ Which procedures have the greatest variability between hospitals?
4/ Are average scores for hospital quality or procedural variability correlated with patient survey responses?


## Phase 1: Setting up the data lake
### Setting up environment:
. Start AWS
. Attached volume & start HDFS + Postgres
	Find the volume location: `fdisk -l`
	   . Mount the volume as follows: `mount -t ext4 /dev/xvdf /data`
	   . Start HDFS, Hadoop Yarn and Hive: `/root/start-hadoop.sh`
	   . Start Postgres: `/data/start_postgres.sh`
	   . Start Hive metastore
	   	- /data/start_metastore.sh
	   	- /data/spark15/bin/spark-sql

. switch to `su w205`

. Run git_load_remove.sh to clone the git repo for execution of loading_and_modelling

. Load data with:
	- `cd w205-exercise_1/loading_and_modelling`
	- `./load_data_lake.sh` to download CMS dataset and load necessary files into HDFS
	- If loading fails, run this to clean the data lake before troubleshooting `./CLEAN_load_data_lake.sh`
	
. Stop hadoop and postgres
	. Stop hive 
		- ps -ef|grep metastore
		- kill <id>
	.`/root/stop-hadoop.sh`
	.`/data/stop_postgres.sh`

### Identify key metrics for hospital and state evaluation as the models of high-quality care:
- Understand the data source
	- Hospital (hospitals.csv)
		- Contains all type of hospitals (i.e. acute care, emmergencies, level-1 trauma, etc)
		- For comparison, would need to segment and focus on a specific type of hospitals:
			- Size
			- Population serving
			- Population proportion
			- Type of services provided
	- High-quality care metrics:
		- Readmission rate
		- Patient satisfaction

	- Measure Dates.csv -> measures.csv
		- Contain key mapping for measures
		- Key: Measure ID
. Potential problems with the data:
	- This dataset is from CMS, thus the data might be skewed as it represents a Medicare population rather than a truly generalized American population


## Phase 2: 
### EDA questions
- What is the distribution of "Hospital overall rating" in the hospital.csv?

### Exploring the dataset: 
`select hospital_type, count(*) from hospitals group by hospital_type;`
`select state, count(*) from hospitals where hospital_type like '%Acute%' 
group by state order by state;`
. There are 3 types of hospitals observed from the data:
	Childrens: 99
	Acute Care hospitals: 3369
	Critical Access hospitals: 1344 - critical access hospital is a designation given to certain rural hospitals by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)

`select emergency_services, count(*) from hospital_info group by emergency_services;`
. With emergency services
	No      238
	Yes     3131

. With meets criteria:
	Not Available   1
	Y       3075
	        55
For this review purpose, I would focus on Acute Care hospitals with emergency services and meet CM<S criteria since childrens and critical access hospitals serve different purposes and certainly would require different measuring metrics./

### transforming data lake
`source hospital_info.sql`
. hospital_info: contain information and CMS-aggregated measures for acute care hospitals with emergency services only, excluding childrens and critical access hospitals.

`source hospital_compare.sql`
. hospital_compare:
	provider_id,
	hospital_overall_rating,
	mortality_national_comparison,
	safety_of_care_national_comparison,
	readmission_national_comparison,
	patient_experience_national_comparison,
	effectiveness_of_care_national_comparison,
	timeliness_of_care_national_comparison,
	efficient_use_of_medical_imaging_national_comparison

`source hospital_baseline.sql`
. hospital_baseline: for each CMS measure and its comparison to national, each comparison can be 'above', 'below' or 'no different than the national average'. Using this, I transform the comparison into a score, with 3 for 'above national average', 1 for 'below national average', and 2 for 'no different' or null variable. This allows me to aggregate the score later into one combined metric for measuring the performance of each hospital.
	provider_id,
	mortality_score,
	safety_score,
	readmission_score,
	patient_experience_score,
	effectiveness_score,
	timeliness_score,
	efficiency_score

`source states_hospital_count.sql`
. states_hospital_count: count number of hospitals per state
	state
	hospital_count


## Phase 3: investigating
### Question 1: Top hospitals in the nation using CMS metrics
`source top_hospital.sql`
. Using hospital_baseline with CMS-aggregated metrics, these are the top 10 hospitals in the country:
	CITIZENS MEDICAL CENTER VICTORIA        TX      Voluntary non-profit - Other    20
	SHANNON MEDICAL CENTER  SAN ANGELO      TX      Voluntary non-profit - Private  19

	AVERA HEART HOSPITAL OF SOUTH DAKOTA    SIOUX FALLS     SD      Proprietary     19


### Question 2: What states are models of high-quality care?
`source transforming\states_hospital_count.sql`
`select * from states_hospital_count`
States that include on acute care hospitals, not surprisingly most hospitals concentrated in states with dense population
	AK      8
	AL      81
	AR      42
	AS      1
	AZ      51
	CA      256
	CO      46
	CT      27
	DC      7
	DE      6
	FL      165
	GA      95
	GU      1
	HI      12
	IA      34
	ID      11
	IL      118
	IN      75
	KS      41
	KY      64
	LA      71
	MA      55
	MD      43

	MO      70
	MP      1
	MS      55
	MT      12
	NC      82
	ND      8
	NE      18
	NH      12
	NJ      62
	NM      29
	NV      19
	NY      143
	OH      114
	OK      77
	OR      34
	PA      134
	PR      46
	RI      11
	SC      51
	SD      16
	TN      87
	TX      280
	UT      31
	VA      73
	VI      2
	VT      6
	WA      48
	WI      63
	WV      28
	WY      10

To determine the states that are models of high-quality care, I calculate the percentage of hospitals in the top 50 for each state. 
`source investigating/top_hospitals.sql`
Top 5 states with highest percentage of hospitals in the top 50 based on the rating:
SD      0.125
KS      0.09756097
IN      0.093333334
HI      0.083333336
IL      0.076271184
MO      0.071428575


### Question 3: Which procedures have the greatest variability between hospitals?
Using data from care_transformed table, I estimate the variance of each procedure with measure_id grouping and score. The measures and scores are selected based on actual scores and excluded those measures with step metrics (i.e. above, below, etc.). I only inlcude measures that have more than 30 entries to avoid small sample bias.
The top 10 procedures that have the highest variance are:

ED_2b	Admit Decision Time to ED Departure Time for Admitted Patients
OP_18b	Median Time from ED Arrival to ED Departure for Discharged ED Patients
ED_1b   Median Time from ED Arrival to ED Departure for Admitted ED Patients
OP_31	Percentage of patients aged 18 years and older who had cataract surgery and had improvement in visual function achieved within 90 days following the cataract surgery
OP_23	Head CT or MRI Scan Results for Acute Ischemic Stroke or Hemorrhagic Stroke Patients who Received Head CT or MRI Scan Interpretation 
OP_3b	Median Time to Transfer to Another Facility for Acute Coronary Intervention- Reporting Rate
OP_29	Appropriate Follow-Up Interval for Normal Colonoscopy in Average Risk Patients
OP_30	Colonoscopy Interval for Patients with a History of Adenomatous Polyps - Avoidance of Inappropriate Use
OP_2	Fibrinolytic Therapy Received Within 30 Minutes of ED Arrival
OP_20	Median Time from ED Arrival to Provider Contact for ED patients

### Question 4: Are average scores for hospital quality or procedural variability correlated with patient survey responses?
Join transform_surveys and best_hospitals so that we can compute the correlation coefficient 
between hospital ranking (rating) score and patients survey responses regarding nurse, doctor etc.

Correlation between hospital score and survey rating:
Nurse rating =0.5340670295160149       
Doctor rating =0.4434510774602345     
Staff rating =0.5186374103477489     
Pain management=0.48148498316864735    
Quality communication =0.450553145164991      
Environment =0.44895231097870686       
Quality discharge =0.44964214024464566 
Overall hospital performance=0.563389188296042

Hospital rating (by previously described method) correlate well with patients survey rating.
In particular, staff rating and hospital rating is the highest, followed by environment rating, 
patient rating of the hospital,doctor rating, nurse rating, pain management, pain medicine communication, 
and quality discharge.

It seems the method used to access the quality of care is well correlated with patients' assessment.
From the correlation, it would be advised for hospitals to invest resource to staff then hospital enviroment.
